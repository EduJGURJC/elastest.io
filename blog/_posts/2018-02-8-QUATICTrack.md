The ElasTest's project coordinator is co-chairing with Hui Song (SINTEF) the track [**Quality Aspects in Cloud-based Platforms and Services**][TRACK] as part of the [**11th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology**][QUATIC] (QUATIC'18) to be held in Coimbra, Portugal between the 4th and 7th of September this year. The track will bring together researchers from Academia with the aim of sharing new ideas and present research on the state of the art in testing cloud-native applications, or leveraging cloud services for quality testing in some way, including testing in the cloud, testing for the cloud, and testing of the cloud.

One of the key properties of cloud technologies is their promise for **scalability** and **resilience**, along with the ability to use many services provided and managed by cloud providers. The pay-as-you-go promise is also seen as one of the things that is attracting startups and SMEs to the cloud. However, all these properties pose a big challenge when it comes to testing. On one side, cloud-based applications might need to test for resiliency and scalability. On the other side, testing tools need to be brought to the cloud, and they also need to be aware of the cloud in order to assess the quality of the application.

In ElasTest, as one of the first tools to target specifically **testing of cloud-native applications**, we have a deep knowledge of the challenges faced by testers and developers when testing applications in the cloud. The track will be a good opportunity to share ideas, challenges to come, and approaches to advance the state of the art on testing cloud-native applications.

**Topics** of interest include, among others: 

* Testing in the cloud
* Testing for the cloud
* Testing of the cloud
* Testing microservices
* Configuration management in testing
* Performance testing of scalable applications
* Security testing in cloud-native applications
* Functional testing of cloud-native applications
* Test architectures for cloud-based testing
* Chaos engineering in testing
* Test orchestration for complex testing suites
* Test services

So we invite you to submit your works to the track, and participate in this event that will be a good occasion to see for yourself the problems that we will need to tackle in the following years. The **submission** process is open right now and up to **Friday, April 20**. All dates are available in our [**Call for Papers**][C4P].

See you in Coimbra this September!
