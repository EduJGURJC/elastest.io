                          <p>This community is led by a benevolent dictator and managed by the community. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, the benevolent dictator has the last word. It is the benevolent dictator’s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is community’s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution.

                              Patxi Gortázar and Micael Gallego are appointed as Benevolent Dictators and project leaders. However, because the community always has the ability to fork, these persons are fully answerable to the community. The project leads are expected to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.

                              In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictators is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the ElasTest expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the vision of the project leaders. The leaders job is then to ensure that the committers (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the committers are aligned with the project’s strategy, the project lead will allow them to proceed as they desire.
                              
                              Additionally, the ElasTest Community considers the project leaders primary point of contact or first point of contact of the project for business purposes including technical services.

                              Committers are contributors who have made sustained valuable contributions to the project and now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In this case, Committers are members of the original research project consortium prior to the foundation of the ElasTest Community. A committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of a committee is to provide guidance and support to the project leaders.

                              Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a committee's job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Also committers are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code (the ones developed within the funded project). That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the lead.

                                          This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
