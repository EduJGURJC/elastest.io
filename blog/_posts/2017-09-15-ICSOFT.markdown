On July 24-26 the **12th International Conference on Software Technologies (ICSOFT)** was held in Madrid, and ElasTest was there. It was a great occasion to share advances of software development with other international researchers. 

Boni Garc√≠a, member of the team working on ElasTest Project at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC) presented a contribution entitled **WebRTC Testing: State of the art**. This work is a first step in the development of WebRTC testing features within the ElasTest Platform. URJC has a lot of experience in WebRTC technologies, as Kurento, the leading open source WebRTC media server, was created here. This background will be very helpful for ElasTest.

Besides that, ICSOFT2017 hosted an European Project Space, where several European projects  presented their progresses. ElasTest participated with an exhibition booth showcasing the ElasTest Platform features to the conference attendants. Several researchers showed their interest in using ElasTest in their research and development activities.

Last, but not least, Boni Garcia participated in a panel for European projects focused on **Challenges and Opportunities in H2020 in the field of Machine Learning and Information Systems**, presenting the ElasTest Project as a successful European project: a good and achievable idea, with a good consortium and with a strong interest in the industry.

Good bug hunting!
