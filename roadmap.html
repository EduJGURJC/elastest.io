                        <p>The project takes as inputs the ideas specified in the objectives and a set of input technologies provided by the partners. From them, the consortium executes the research and development activities creating the ElasTest services. There are validated through experimental proofs of concept. During this year the agile cycle shall be limited to stages to define, built and learn. Being research and development the main target of efforts during the first three releases.</p>

                        <p>The platform is integrated as a whole through a CI methodology and with the support of a CI tool where tests validating the platform in a controlled lab environment are executed. These tests collect requirements coming from four relevant vertical domains (Video transmission, Internet of Things, Software defined networks and Web and Mobile apps). In parallel, research and development activities continue under that CI umbrella. As a result, ElasTest is validated in relevant industrial environments. Hence, the Test stage shall become important through activities providing valuable insight in relation to whether ElasTest is appropriately implemented.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the research and development and the integration/validation activities, during this phase a demonstration activity in launched on four vertical domains. This demonstration follows a rigorously defined methodology using empirical surveys, comparative case studies and (quasi)-experiments. As a result, the most mature ElasTest results are demonstrated in relevant industrial environments. Hence, the Experiment and Measure stages will be activated through the vertical demonstrators. During this period, the demonstration activities will gain maximum relevance for the project.</p>
