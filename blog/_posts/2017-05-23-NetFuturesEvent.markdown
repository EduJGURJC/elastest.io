[**NET FUTURES 2017**](http://netfuturesconference.eu) will serve as a forum to debate the shape of Internet in the years to come. How will Internet look like in 2027? This event is for everyone to discuss and learn where the "Internetisation" of everything will lead us to. 

ElasTest will be participating in the event, by attending the **Concertation Meeting for H2020 projects** hosted by [CloudWatch](http://www.cloudwatchhub.eu). This meeting is focused on new cloud service and software for the *Digital Single Market* (a sector that includes digital marketing, e-commerce and telecommunications). Specifically, we are going to participate in the break-out session on **Software Engineering for Services and Applications**, one of the European Commission clusters around Cloud Computing, leaded by Elisabetta Di Nitto.

Apart from trending and new directions in the Cloud Computing world, the Concertation Meeting is a good starting point from where to gather information about project exploitation from other successful projects in the area.
