Elastest is announcing its participation at the [Berlin 5G Week](http://www.berlin5gweek.org/), by demoing the platform at the [IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks](http://nfvsdn2017.ieee-nfvsdn.org/). The demo will showcase the successful integration of [OpenBaton](https://openbaton.github.io/) and [Open5GCore](https://www.open5gcore.org/) with the ElasTest Platform. 

Concretely, the System under Test (SuT) will consist of an Open5GCore Evolved Packet Core (EPC) deployment containing the following components: HSS, SGWC-PGWC-MME, SGGU-PGWU, BT, INET-GW. The SuT will be deployed using Open Baton as orchestrator. Once deployed, the SuT will interact with the ElasTest platform through a REST interface between the Benchmarking Tool (providing the means for quantitative evaluations of novel concepts within the core network) and the tests (assessing the quality of the benchmark performed). The test results as well as monitored SuT metrics are collected by agents which forward it to the LogStash-based monitoring system provided by ElasTest. This approach enables a complete diagnosis in case of errors.

If you're planning to attend the conference, stop by our booth and ask us to show you how ElasTest can help you keep your 5G infrastructure in good health.

We are looking forward to meeting you at the Berlin 5G Week!
